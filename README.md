# page_rankr

Provides an easy way to retrieve Google Page Rank, Alexa Rank, and backlink counts.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

## TODO
* Get backlink counts for:
  * Google
  * Bing
  * Yahoo!
  * AltaVista
  * AllTheWeb
* Get Google Page Rank
  * Implement Hashing Algorithm
* Get Alexa ranking
